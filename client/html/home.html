                        The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares. You are X, your friend is O. Players take turns 
                        putting their marks in empty squares. The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or 
                        diagonally) is the winner. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over.

                            Players first need to select their grid size. Players take turn in joining two adjacent(vertically or 
                            horizontally) dots. The player who finishes connects a square will own the square. The player who owns 
                            the most squares at the end of the game wins the game.
